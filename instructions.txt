You are an astronaut exploring an uninhabited planet. Unfortunately, an intense sandstorm has ripped all the hatch panels off your ships. You need to put them back on and load your ships up with cargo. Use the arrow keys to walk around and press the spacebar to pick up and place cargo and hatch panels on your ships. Remember: you have to cover up a hatch with a panel before you can place a cargo in that spot. Fill up the ships before the timer gets to zero and the next sandstorm arrives. Good luck!
